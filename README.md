A built-in osc UI inside _"MPV_lazy"_ https://github.com/hooke007/MPV_lazy

It is modified from _"mpv_thumbnail_script"_ https://github.com/TheAMM/mpv_thumbnail_script
and official "osc.lua" https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/blob/master/player/lua/osc.lua

## Installation
Just download all files into your mpv'config folder!

Remember to back you original `osc.conf` file.

(It is not compatible with other `osc-like` files.)

You should add `osc=no` and `load-scripts=yes` in your `mpv.conf`
